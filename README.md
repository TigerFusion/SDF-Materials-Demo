# SDF-Materials-Demo
Raymarching demo with SDFs (signed distance fields) that have different Materials. This 3D WebGL Shader shows how to make shapes with transparency, reflection, and refraction. Also with some editing you can make shapes that use several materials together. Note that all shaders are in the index.html file.

<b>Mouse Controls:</b>

Hold the mouse and drag to view the scene from different angles.
